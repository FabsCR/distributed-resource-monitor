This is the first project for the Operating Systems course.

It implements a distributed system composed of multiple nodes that cooperate to execute tasks while being automatically monitored in real-time. The system dynamically distributes workloads based on the current usage of each node's resources (CPU, memory, storage, and network) to ensure efficient and balanced task execution.
